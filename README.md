# Machine-Learning---Breast-Cancer

Breast cancer is a common cancer and a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide. It highlights the importance of early detection to lower mortality rates and improve survival outcomes. In this project, a machine learning model which employs an effective discriminant function is used to classify breast tumors based on various features like size, texture, etc. The proposed algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) will enhance the diagnostic procedure.

To evaluate these models, we are comparing them based on performance measures such as the ROC-AUC and classification reports so as to be able to identify the most effective approach for tumor classification. The models can therefore be used to enhance diagnostic accuracy since they help improve and ensure more reliable and consistent results even when human error plays a role. This will, in turn, aid in early detection of more reliable results.
